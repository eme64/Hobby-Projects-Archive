Here I document some of my projects I have done over the years

You can go into the subdirectories and look at the images, code and run the executables on windows.

Unfortunately the languages (Blitz3D and BlitzMax) have been discontinued due to a lack of funding. But it was really lots of fun and especially BlitzMax was very easy to learn but one could also use it for big projects as it was quite powerful.
But since the community still loves the languages, especially BlitzMax, I am sure the compilers can still be found (Win, Linux, Mac).
