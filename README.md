# Hobby-Projects-Archive
Here I document some of my projects I have done over the years

You can go into the subdirectories and look at the images, code and run the executables on windows.

BlitzMax does also run on Linux, so most projects can also be compiled by the viewer.

I will add a nicer presentation soon.
