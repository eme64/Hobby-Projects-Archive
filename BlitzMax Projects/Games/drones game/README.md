this game was basically a clone of "duskers", just wanted to see how far I could make it.

Mayve first play duskers first, because this game only makes sense as a clone.

What I tested was the commandline and the bots that automatically run around the open rooms.

---------------   The commands are:

dock a<dock-number>

remote r<room-number>   # also used to unpower before powering an other room

navigate <list of bot numbers, only spaces in between, or "all"> r<room-nr>

reroute { r<room-nr> }*  # list of rooms, each must be next to one that is already powered, so start with the one that is remote-powered!

open d<door-nr>  # or a<outer door nr>

close d<door-nr>  # or a<outer door nr>

you can also just type "d<door-nr>" to toggle a door
