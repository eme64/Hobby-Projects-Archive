this game was basically a clone of "duskers", just wanted to see how far I could make it.

Mayve first play duskers first, because this game only makes sense as a clone.

What I tested was the commandline and the bots that automatically run around the open rooms.

---------------   The commands are:

dock a<dock-number>

remote r< room-number >   # also used to unpower before powering an other room

navigate < list of bot numbers, only spaces in between, or "all" > r< room-nr >

reroute { r< room-nr > }*  # list of rooms, each must be next to one that is already powered, so start with the one that is remote-powered!

open d< door-nr >  # or a< outer door nr >

close d< door-nr >  # or a< outer door nr >

you can also just type "d< door-nr >" to toggle a door
