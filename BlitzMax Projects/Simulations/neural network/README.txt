This is one of the cooler examples.

Press space to see something, release to render faster.

The bots have sensors and try to find food to survive.
They are steered by a neural network.
Offspring get a slightly perturbed network.

After a while the bots become much better, just let it run for a while.
(best without pressing space-bar to get faster simulation)
